```

### Usage

```javascript
    import React, { Component } from 'react'
    // import the library
	import RavePaymentModal from 'react-ravepayment'

    class App extends Component {

    		state = {
    		  key: "FLWPUBK-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX-X", // RavePay PUBLIC KEY
    		  email: "foo@example.com", // customer email
    		  amount: 1000 // equals NGN 1000. Minimum amount allowed NGN 1 while on production or live system, it's 10
    	    }

    	  callback = (response) => {
    		  console.log(response);

    	  }

    	  close = () => {
    		  console.log("Payment closed");
    	  }

    	  getReference = () => {
    		  let text = "";
    		  let possible = "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789-.=";

    		  for( let i=0; i < 10; i++ )
    			  text += possible.charAt(Math.floor(Math.random() * possible.length));

			  return text;
    	  }

    	render () {
        return (
          <div className='App'>
            <p className='App-intro'>
    	        <RavePaymentModal
    		        text="Make Payment"

    		        amount={this.state.amount}
    		        ravePubKey={this.state.key}
